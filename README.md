🚀 HarambeeCore™ Bridge Simulation System
A Streamlit-hosted simulation for milestone-driven smart contracts pegged to historical gold prices (XAUUSD).
This system showcases how financial commitments can be transparently tracked and triggered using real-world market data — supporting innovations in decentralized finance and civic transparency.

🔧 Features
📈 Milestone Simulation from historical gold (XAUUSD) data

📜 Smart Contract Logic with triggered alerts

📊 Gap Analysis based on price volatility trends

🖥️ Streamlit Dashboard UI for stakeholder visibility and testing

streamlit run streamlit_app.py
📥 Preparing Your Data
Add a historical dataset: XAUUSD_historical.csv to the gap/ folder

Use a semicolon (;) separator

Ensure at least these two columns:

Date (format: YYYY-MM-DD)

Close (daily closing price of gold)

🧠 Next Steps
 Automate test coverage with GitHub Actions

 Add .env support for secret configs (e.g., alerts API, integration keys)

 Expand to support multi-asset triggers (e.g., Brent, BTC)

 Link milestone simulation to blockchain smart contract execution (e.g., via Web3.py)
